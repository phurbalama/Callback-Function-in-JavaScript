# Callback-Function-in-JavaScript
A callback function is a function passed into another fucntion as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. 
In this javascript file, I showcased that callback functions are very important to get results because some functions can take longer to lad than other functions which results in undefined value being returned. Therfore, using callback function will allow correct result to be called.
